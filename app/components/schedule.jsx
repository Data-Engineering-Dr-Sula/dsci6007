          Class slides (and instructorâ€™s notes if given) do not replace class.
          If they are provided it is with the intention of freeing up your time
          to take additional notes, not to allow you to minimize effort.
          Mathematical topics are difficult to teach via slides, so often
          specific topics will be demonstrated or derived on the board,
          requiring notetaking. This is a contrast with programming topics which
          often work better via slides. Those with a computer science background
          may need to relearn note taking habits.
