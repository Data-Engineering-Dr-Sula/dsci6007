    "description": "Class slides (and instructorâ€™s notes if given) do not replace class. If they are provided it is with the intention of freeing up your time to take additional notes, not to allow you to minimize effort. Mathematical topics are difficult to teach via slides, so often specific topics will be demonstrated or derived on the board, requiring notetaking. This is a contrast with programming topics which often work better via slides. Those with a computer science background may need to relearn note taking habits.",
